# 16.  CONTENTIOUS FORKS IN THE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN

 
In the event of a Hard Fork in the underlying Permissionless Blockchain: 

* By default, the legal representation of the DAO remains on the Majority Chain and any Off-Chain Assets will belong to the DAO on the Majority Chain.

* The DAO may choose to maintain legal presence on a Minority Chain if it expresses its intent to do so by Public Signaling, and in that case any Off-Chain Assets will belong to the DAO on the selected Minority Chain.

* The DAO may liquidate its On-Chain Assets following a Hard Fork in order to move those Assets to the chosen chain.

* Alternatively, the DAO may choose to split into multiple legal entities, each on a separate chain, if it communicates by Public Signaling:

  * its intent to do so, and

  * there is a definitive distribution of Off-Chain Assets between the Majority and Minority Chain(s).
